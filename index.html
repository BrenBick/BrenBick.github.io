          <h1>My Story</h1>
          <p class="major">
            Hey there! I'm Brendan Bickford, and for over 12 years, I've had a
            passion for programming. It all began with a fascination for
            creating and modding games in Java. There's something incredibly
            empowering about creating something out of nothing with just a
            keyboard and a bit of imagination.

          <h2>My Education</h2>
          <p>
            After years of programming as a hobby, I decided to go to pursue a
            degree in computer science. In 2020, I began my education at Simon
            Fraser University. Over 4 years, I studied the foundations of
            software development, mathematics, and technical writing. In my
            final year of University, I focused my studies on Artificial
            Intelligence, completing projects in machine learning, data science,
            and computer vision. This resulted in me achieving my Bachelor of
            Science in Computer Science with a technical concentration in
            Artificial Intelligence from SFU in April of 2024.
